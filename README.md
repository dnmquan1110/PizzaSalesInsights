The pizza store want to know clearly and deeply about sales in 2015. They want to know specifically about the revenue, the daily trend, the monthly trend of orders, which pizza is in top best-sellers,...From that, they will find ways to increase sales in the future.

## **Solution approach**
To address the statement, I used the following approach:

The data is imported into a SQL database, and the insights were drawn from the data using SQL queries to gain a preliminary understanding of the sales trend.
* **Connecting SQL database to Power BI**
The SQL database was connected to Power BI, establishing a live connection

Using the Power Query editor to transform, prepare and transform data

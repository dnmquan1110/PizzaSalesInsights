# **Pizza Sales Insights using SQL and Power BI**
## **Problem Statement**
The pizza store need to analyze key indicators for our pizza sales data to gain insights into the business performance. Specifically, they want to know some following metrics: total revenue, average order value, total pizza sold, total orders, average pizza per order. After that, they would like to visualize various espect of pizza sales data to gain insights and understand key trends, specifically with the following requirements:
1. Daily trend for Total Orders
2. Monthly trend for Total Orders
3. Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category
4. Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size
5. Total Pizza Sold by Pizza Category
6. Top 5 best sellers by revenue, total quantity and total orders
7. Bottom 5 best sellers by revenue, total quantity and total orders

## **Solution approach**
To address the statement, I used the following approach:
* **Data import and Initial Analysis** : 
The data is imported into a SQL database, and the insights were drawn from the data using SQL queries to gain a preliminary understanding of the sales trend.
* **Connecting SQL database to Power BI** : 
The SQL database was connected to Power BI, establishing a live connection
* **Data cleaning and Transformation** : 
Using the Power Query editor to transform, prepare and transform data
* **Dashboard creation** : 
The dashboard performed insights of data,provided visualizations and metrics to sales performance (sales by category/size), orders performance (daily/monthly trend), customer segmentation (top pizza were sold by revenue/orders/names)
